# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

I developed a simple but entirely functional password manager using Kotlin. The software allows the user to store and manage their login credentials for various websites. It incorporates features such as user authentication and encryption/decryption. 

I created this program primarily to deepen and improve my understanding of the Kotlin language and how it works, so that I have more experience and knowledge of the language in the future. It also sounded like something interesting to create, and although simple, it is a very useful piece of software.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

In regards to the tools I used, primarily utilized VSC to write the code, as well as testing and using a few other development environments.

The programming language used was of course Kotlin. I also used some Java libraries to make my software's functions easier, such as java.security and javax.crypto.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Include a GUI with the software to make it clearer and more user friendly.
- Integrate some kind of cloud/online storage for the passwords so that it can be accessed from more than one device.
- Add additional security features such as 2FA.
- Add a function that automatically generates strong passwords for the user.
